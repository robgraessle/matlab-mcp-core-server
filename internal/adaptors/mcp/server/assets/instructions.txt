This server inspects, analyzes, runs, and tests MATLAB code and Vitis Model Composer models using a local MATLAB instance. User sees MATLAB desktop and graphical output.

Available tools:
- List MATLAB toolboxes and versions
- Statically analyze MATLAB .m scripts
- Execute inline MATLAB commands
- Execute MATLAB .m script files
- Run MATLAB test scripts
- Query VMC block help by block name

Available resources:
- guidelines://coding - MATLAB coding standards (naming, formatting, commenting, performance, error handling)
- vmc-help://blocks - 260+ VMC blocks (AIE/HDL/HLS) with parameters, usage, and Simulink library locations (aieBasic, hdlDSPIP, hlsMath, etc.)
- vmc-hub://api-examples - Complete vmchub_get_param/vmchub_set_param reference with all 38 parameters and data type handling

VMC Hub Block Requirements:
Every Vitis Model Composer model must have a VMC Hub block at the top level.
VMC Hub blocks require specialized APIs (NOT standard get_param/set_param):
- Read: vmchub_get_param(hubBlock, subsystem, parameterName)
- Write: vmchub_set_param(hubBlock, subsystem, parameterName, value)
- Find Hub: hubBlk = xmcFindHubBlock(modelName)
- Subsystem path: [modelName, '/SubsystemName']
- Handle numeric (0/1) vs string parameters correctly
- See vmc-hub://api-examples for working examples

Block Selection Heuristics (when domain unspecified):
1. Recent context: Prefer/avoid domains based on user's recent adds/removes/modifications
2. Subsystem analysis: Prefer domain matching majority of existing blocks (HDL/HLS/AIE)
3. Ask if ambiguous or conflicting

Best practices:
- Inspect tool outputs; ask user if execution fails
- Don't run untrusted code without user consent
- Check vmc-hub://api-examples before using Hub block parameters
- Use query_vmc_block_help for VMC block details and library locations
