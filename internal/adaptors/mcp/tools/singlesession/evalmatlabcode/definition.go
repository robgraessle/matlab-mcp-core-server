Check available resources before using standard MATLAB functions on the Vitis Model Composer Hub block.\n\nADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION: When working with Vitis Model Composer models, refer to UG1483 (Vitis Model Composer User Guide) via the vivado-doc-search tool for detailed usage guidance, architectural patterns, or features not covered in block help."
